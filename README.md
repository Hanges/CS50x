*Personal Log*

Hi. My Name is Rafael Hanges and I'm a 37yo "Married with Childrens" Kind of Guy. I Love my Family. And this is Important.

Back In 1995-1996 I was a 12yo Kid with a Computer, a 2400 bauds modem and an Analog Phone Line. The First Service I Deployed was a BBS (Bulletin Board System). My first Online Game Experience was hosting and modding a game called "LORD" (Legend of the Red Dragon), a Text Only RPG Game. The Gameplay was not different from any modern mobile online app, except that the graphics were ANSI and ASCII Arts, in 16 colors. Great BBS Times. The taglines. The Blue Wave. The atx3dp (for pulse). Nope.

The Prime Time Show on TV was a Soap Opera called "Explode Coração". The "Nerd Nice Guy" is "Addicted to Internet" and meets the "Gypsie Nice Girl". They fall in love. In the Internet you can be anyone. Online, She was Free, but Offline she was forced to Marry the "Gypsie Bad Guy" called Cigano Igor", that became reference for "Bad Acting" in the years later.

Top Eterteinment available in Brazilian TV.

Thanks to the Show, "Internet" became a Word, as well "Web" and "Download".

Soon or Later I had access to a list with numbers, usernames and passwords to some providers to dial using a software called "Trumpet", on the Windows 3.11. 

Hello Internet. I Was Waiting for You.
